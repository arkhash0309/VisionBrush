# VisionBrush

## Introduction
VisionBrush is an application which utilizes hand gestures and movements to draw on a digital canvas. 
This project makes use of computer vision techniques which keep track of the movements of the user's hands and fingers (mainly the thumb and the index finger).

## Functionalities
<li>Recognition of hand movements and gestures using the Mediapipe library in Python.</li>
<li>Customiable color canvas.</li>
<li>Real-time coordinate detection of fingers and nodes.</li>
<li>Ability to reset canvas.</li>

## Execution
<ul>Move the fingers in your hand for the detection to occur.</ul>
<ul>Colors can be changed by moving fingers to the respective color box.</ul>
<ul>Clear the canvas using the respective button.</ul>
<ul>Close the application using the 'z' key</ul>

## Techniques
<ul>Color definitions</ul>
<ul>Dequeues</ul>
<ul>Kernalization for image processing</ul>
<ul>Canvas creation</ul>
<ul>Text rendering</ul>
<ul>Usage of drawing utilities</ul>
<ul>Mediapipe hands for detection of hand landmarks</ul>
<ul>Webcam capture</ul>
<ul>RGB conversion and flipping of frames</ul>
<ul>Thumb and forefinger distance calculation</ul>

## Image processing concepts
<ul>Noise reduction and contour enhancement</ul>
<ul>Hand landmark detection</ul>
<ul>Real time processing</ul>
<ul>Drawing and annotation</ul>

## Dependencies
<ul>numpy -> 1.26.4</ul>
<ul>opencv-python -> 4.9.0.80</ul>
<ul>mediapipe -> 0.10.14</ul>
